# Stochastic TSP-GL

## Description

The goal of this software is to determine the solution of a stochastic traveling salesman problem with generalized latency. A preprint of this paper is available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09190).

This software contains four folders: `data`, `generators`, `results`, `solver`. 
- `data`: contains data for the case study of our paper.
- `generator`: generates a problem instance for our case study via `TSPLIB_demand.py`.
- `results`: information for runs gets saved here
- `solver`: solves the instance via `advanced_branch.py`


## Results

The results in the paper were generated by this software that had been carried out using Python 3.8.11 and Gurobi 9.5 on a desktop computer with Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-9900, 3.1 GHz CPU and 20 GB of RAM, running
Ubuntu 20.04.


## Replicating
To replicate the results of an instance of our case study run `python ./start_run.py [dimension] [scenarios] [seed] [theta] [rho] [alpha] [run_option] [arcs] [value_of_stochastic_solution]`.
The following input arguments are valid:

| Argument | Inputs |
| --- | --- |
| dimension |[14, 16, 17, 21, 22, 24, 26, 29, 42, 48, 51, 52, 70, 76.1, 76.2, 96, 99, 100.1, 100.2, 100.3, 100.4, 100.5, 101] |
| scenarios | positive integers |
| seed | positiv integers |
| theta | 0 <= theta <= 1 |
| rho | 0 <= rho <= 1 |
| alpha | 0 <= alpha <= 1 |
| run_option | ['MIP', 'CG', 'heuristic', 'hybrid'] |
| arcs | ['all', 'reachable'] |
| value_of_stochastic_solution | [True, False] |

Running an instance with 21 nodes, 20 scenarios, seed 0, theta 0.95, rho 0.05, alpha 0.25, with our column generation based branch-and-price 'CG', with arcs 'all', and not calculating the value of stochastic solution 'False'  can be done via 
`python .\run_algorithms.py 21 20 0 0.95 0.05 0.25 CG all False`
